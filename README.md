# Arduino-Potentiometer

#What It Does

This Arduino project demonstrates how to use a potentiometer as an analog input to control the brightness of an LED using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). 

The analog input is read from pin A0, scaled to a PWM output (0â€“255), and then written to digital pin 11 to adjust the LED brightness.

Real-time ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) values and corresponding voltage readings are also printed to the Serial Monitor for live monitoring.
